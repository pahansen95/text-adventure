I want to implement a Proof of Concept (PoC) of a Text Based Adventure Game. I have described the design & theory of the game engine. Help me think through how to architect, design & implement the game engine.

First, I should set goals & success criteria for the PoC:

- Goal: Create a simple text based adventure that allows users to play the game through natural language.
- Success Criteria
  - Use an LLM to control the game engine with natural language.
  - Implement a minimal game engine tightly coupled to the game's content (ie. avoid generalizing the implementation)
  - Provide basic game play mechanics:
    - Inventory (ex. Storage Space, Weight, etc...)
    - Status (ex. Equipment, Buffs, DeBuffs, Health, MP, SP, EXP, etc...)
    - Traversal (ex. Move the player within the "map")
    - Gathering (ex. Allow the player to gather resources & materials from the world)
    - Crafting (ex. Allow the player to craft weapons, armors, tools & potions from gathered materials)
    - Battle (ex. Allow the player to fight enemies & gain EXP)

<meta hidden k=strat>
Context: Design doc outlines a distributed entity-based game engine with natural language control. Need to scope a PoC implementation.
User expects: Practical architectural guidance for implementing core game mechanics while adhering to the design philosophy.
Implicit knowledge: Game engine architecture, state management, event systems, entity component systems.
Key takeaways: Start with core abstractions, identify minimal viable features, suggest concrete implementation steps.
Ordering: 1) Core architecture, 2) State management, 3) Implementation approach, 4) Next steps.
</meta>

Let's break this down into manageable pieces. I'll focus on core architecture first:

1. Core Components
```python
class Entity:
    def __init__(self, id: str, capabilities: set[Capability], state: dict):
        self.id = id
        self.capabilities = capabilities
        self.state = state

class World:
    def __init__(self):
        self.entities: dict[str, Entity] = {}
        self.microcosms: dict[str, set[str]] = {}  # Maps microcosm_id -> entity_ids
```

2. State Management
```python
# Example state interfaces
class PlayerState:
    inventory: dict[str, int]  # item_id -> quantity
    position: tuple[int, int]  # x, y coordinates
    stats: dict[str, float]    # health, mp, sp, etc

class ItemState:
    weight: float
    stack_limit: int
    properties: dict[str, Any]
```

3. Implementation Strategy:
- Start with a single microcosm containing:
  - Player entity
  - Item entities (resources, equipment)
  - Location entities (map tiles)
- Implement basic capabilities:
  ```python
  class MoveCapability(Capability):
      async def execute(self, direction: str) -> bool
  
  class GatherCapability(Capability):
      async def execute(self, target_item: str) -> bool
  ```
- Use a simple event system for entity interactions

Questions for consideration:
1. Should we implement the LLM integration first or focus on the core engine?
2. How should we handle state persistence?
3. What's the minimal set of entities needed for a playable demo?

Would you like me to expand on any of these areas or discuss a specific implementation aspect?

Let's focus for now on implementing an Entity. Review the Game Engine Design & Theory. Propose how might we architect & design an Entity?

<meta hidden k=strat>
Context: Entity is core to the design; defined as any programmatic object contributing to the Game World with Capabilities & State.
User expects: Technical design aligned with the distributed, non-omnipotent architecture described.
Implicit knowledge: Event-driven systems, concurrent programming, state management patterns.
Key takeaways: Entity design must support capabilities, state management, and causal relationships.
Ordering: 1) Core interfaces, 2) Entity composition, 3) Implementation considerations, 4) Discussion points.
</meta>

From the design doc, an Entity must support:
1. Capabilities (Observations, Actions, Reactions)
2. State management
3. Causal relationships with other entities
4. Participation in microcosms

Here's a proposed design:

```python
from typing import Protocol, Any
from abc import ABC, abstractmethod
import asyncio

class Capability(Protocol):
    async def observe(self) -> dict[str, Any]: ...
    async def act(self, action: str, **kwargs) -> Any: ...
    async def react(self, event: str, **kwargs) -> Any: ...

class Entity:
    def __init__(self, id: str):
        self.id = id
        self._capabilities: dict[str, Capability] = {}
        self._state: dict[str, Any] = {}
        self._causal_peers: set[str] = set()
        self._state_lock = asyncio.Lock()
    
    async def add_capability(self, name: str, capability: Capability) -> None:
        self._capabilities[name] = capability
    
    async def update_state(self, updates: dict[str, Any]) -> None:
        async with self._state_lock:
            self._state |= updates
            # Propagate state changes to causal peers
            # TODO: Implement state propagation
    
    def has_agency(self) -> bool:
        """Determines if Entity is an Agent or Fixture"""
        return any(
            hasattr(cap, 'act') 
            for cap in self._capabilities.values()
        )
```

Key considerations:
1. State updates must propagate to causal peers
2. Capabilities define the Entity's interface with the World
3. Agency is determined by action capabilities
4. Concurrent state access requires synchronization

Questions to explore:
1. How should we handle capability dependencies?
2. Should state validation occur at the Entity or Capability level?
3. How do we implement efficient state propagation in microcosms?

Would you like to discuss any of these aspects in detail?
